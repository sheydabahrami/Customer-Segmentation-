### Use cases of Machine Learning in Marketing
Customer Segmentation<br /> Price Optimization<br /> Personalization<br /> Customer Lifetime Value
#### Customer segmentation 
Creating customer personas and mapping customers to personas <br /> Helps organizations know and understand their customers <br /> ML can look at customer characteristics, behavior and identify patterns <br /> Use algorithms to group customers based on similar attributes or characteristics
#### Price optimization (there is an important concept named price elasticity of demand: the degree to which the number of products sold changes when the product's price changes): 
Need to consider a number of factors while assigning prices:
Competition <br /> Market positioning <br /> Production costs <br /> Distribution costs
#### Objective of price optimization
Understanding the price elasticity of demand <br /> Finding the best price of a product given goals
#### Personalization
Implementation of strategies by which companies deliver individualized content to recipients, personalization technologies are as follows:
Wisdom of the crowd <br /> Semantic understanding <br /> Segmentation and targeting <br /> 1:1 Personalization
#### Customer lifetime value
Recency: when was the costumers last order <br /> Frequency: how often do the customers buy on the platform <br /> Monetary: how much do the customer spend on the platform <br /> two models are always used for CLV: 1. probabilistic (Pareto/Negative Binomial Distribution/Beta-geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution) models 2. ML models (linear regression, SVR, deep learning regressors)
