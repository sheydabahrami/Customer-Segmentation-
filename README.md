    Recency: when was the costumers last order
    Frequency: how often do the customers buy on the platform
    Monetary: how much do the customer spend on the platform
two models always are used: 1) probabilistic (Pareto/Negative Binomial Distribution/Beta-geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution
) models 2) ML models (linear regression, SVR, deep learning regressors)
